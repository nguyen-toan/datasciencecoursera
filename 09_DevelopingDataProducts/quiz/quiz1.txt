Question 1
Consider the following code for the cars data set
library(manipulate)
myPlot <- function(s) {
    plot(cars$dist - mean(cars$dist), cars$speed - mean(cars$speed))
    abline(0, s)
}
This function plots distance versus speed, each de-meaned and an associated line of slope s. Which of the following code will make a manipulate plot that creates a slider for the slope?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
manipulate(myPlot(s), s = slider(0, 2, step = 0.1))	Correct	1.00	
manipulate(myPlot(s), x.s = slider(0, 2, step = 0.1))			
manipulate(myPlot(s), slider = x(0, 2, step = 0.1))			
manipulate(myPlot, s = slider(0, 2, step = 0.1))

Question 4
What is incorrect about the followig syntax in ui.R?

library(shiny)
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  headerPanel("Data science FTW!"),
  sidebarPanel(
    h2('Big text')
    h3('Sidebar')
  ),
  mainPanel(
      h3('Main Panel text')
  )
))

Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Missing a comma in the sidebar panel	Correct	1.00	
The "Sidebar" should say "Sidebar text".			
The h2 command has the wrong arguments.			
The h3 command should be an h2 command.

Question 5
Consider the following code in ui.R
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  headerPanel("Example plot"),
  sidebarPanel(
    sliderInput('mu', 'Guess at the mu',value = 70, min = 60, max = 80, step = 0.05,)
  ),
  mainPanel(
    plotOutput('newHist')
  )
))


And the following server.R code.

library(UsingR)
data(galton)

shinyServer(
  function(input, output) {
    output$myHist <- renderPlot({
      hist(galton$child, xlab='child height', col='lightblue',main='Histogram')
      mu <- input$mu
      lines(c(mu, mu), c(0, 200),col="red",lwd=5)
      mse <- mean((galton$child - mu)^2)
      text(63, 150, paste("mu = ", mu))
      text(63, 140, paste("MSE = ", round(mse, 2)))
      })
    
  }
)



Why isn't it doing what we want?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
It should be mu in server.R			
The limits of the slider are set incorrectly and giving an error.			
The server.R output name isn't the same as the plotOutput command used in ui.R.	Correct	1.00	
The phrase "Guess at the mu value" should say "mean" instead of "mu"
